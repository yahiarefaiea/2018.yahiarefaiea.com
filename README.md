# Rapid gulp environment (legacy starter-kit)

A starter-kit built using Gulp and NodeJS to help start projects faster.


## Requirements to run
Gulp `v3.9.1` with Node `v8.17.0`.
> Gulp 3.9.1 will work with **Node 8** (latest noded 8 is 8.17.0) and with nothing newer. It's a dead and unsafe node version. So is the gulp project as a whole (last release in 2019). I could understand if it's a legacy project but using it in new projects should be prosecutable (note: it's my personal opinion only). If you are forced to use it and you have other node version already installed I recommend using **nvm** to manage multiple node versions on your environment.


## Used Commands
Navigate to the project directory then:
- Use `npm run dev` or `npx gulp` to run the project with live reloading using BrowserSync.
- Use `npm run build` or `npx gulp release` to build the project.
- Use `npm run clean` or `npx gulp del` to clean the build directory generated by gulp.


## Few other things
- We used `ES6 JavaScript` using `babel` and you can find all the JS files in the babel/ directory.
- We used pug to generate our html `pug/`, and we linked them together with JSON data `data/`.
- We used `stylus` together with `kouto-swiss` to generate our css files.
